The Brand New Testament is a surreal and subversive film that re-imagines Biblical themes through a modern lens. It follows the story of a woman trapped in a loveless marriage who ends up forming a love relationship with a gorilla, and a dying boy who decides to live his remaining days as a girl. The chaos ensues when God is locked out of his computer and thus rendered powerless. He is forced to endure all the hardships he had earlier inflicted on mankind and is eventually made to stay in on Earth, powerless and alone. Meanwhile, his wife reconfigures a new life for mankind and erases the messages that notified people of their death date. The film has generally garnered positive reviews from both audiences and critics, with a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 82% and an average Metacritic score of 70 out of 100.
