Intro

Welcome fellow cinephiles, to another deep-dive into a mesmerizing film. This time, our cinematic passport is stamped for a remarkable journey to the heart of Belgium, where gods walk among men. We explore the contours of a film that elegantly unboxes religious tradition and refolds it into a thought-provoking package of surreal humor, poignant drama and satirical revelations. Prepare for a healthy dose of existential contemplation as we delve into the 2015 fantasy dark comedy, "The Brand New Testament," directed by renowned filmmaker Jaco Van Dormael.

Story

The film presents an enticingly eccentric view of divinity as it depicts God as a cantankerous sadist residing in a nondescript flat in Brussels, alongside his subservient wife and 10-year-old daughter, Ea. In this universe, God isn't a celestial entity but a decidedly terrestrial figure who takes a perverse pleasure in tormenting the denizens of his creation. Ea, empathetic towards the hapless humanity, kick-starts an anarchic rebellion, leaking everyone's death dates and absconds to Earth. 

She embarks on the ambitious endeavor of writing a 'Brand New Testament,' choosing six unlikely apostles. Through her interactions, the apostles are nudged into unexpected epiphanies, unraveling the fundamental significance of life and love over mere mortality. The parallel narrative of God, locked out of his computer and his cosmos, now forced to grapple with the very adversities he maliciously curated for mankind, adds a touch of divine poetic justice. 

Fun Fact

Did you know that this film is an international co-production among Belgium, France, and Luxembourg? The multilingual aspect it brings was thought to enhance the film's "Tower of Babel" allegory: a single divine tongue diversifying into many. It's fascinating to see the Biblical references sewn into the very fabric of the film, isn't it?

Conclusion

The movie has been widely celebrated, earning several award nominations and securing its place as a cult phenomenon. With its fascinating story, well-rounded characters, and distinctive blend of darkness and humor, it rightfully earns a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 82% and a substantial Metacritic score of 70 out of 100.
