Premium Rush is a fast-paced thriller about a New York City bike messenger caught in a deadly chase, co-written by John Kamps and David Koepp. Filming took place in New York City and ran from mid-July to early September 2010. During production, Gordon-Levitt, the lead actor, suffered an injury that required 31 stitches. After its release, a lawsuit was filed claiming the film plagiarized Joe Quirk's 1998 novel The Ultimate Rush, but the case was dismissed. Despite opening at #8 and grossing a disappointing $31.1 million worldwide against its $35 million budget, the film received positive reviews from critics. It holds a 75% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 6.3/10 and a 66/100 score on Metacritic, suggesting generally favorable reviews. Notably, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded it 3.5 stars out of 4, praising it as a breakneck chase movie.
