{"topic": "Movie Review", "title": "The Cabin in the Woods", "tags": "Movie Review,Horror,Sci-fi,Comedy", "contents": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Friendship, a getaway, and a cabin in the woods - sounds like a regular storyline, doesn't it? But 'The Cabin in the Woods,' is anything but regular. Co-scripted by Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard, the film creates a rich take on the familiar horror theme of youngsters falling prey to terror in an isolated location. Potential viewers be warned though, this twisted story, set in an atypical world, is sure to make you question the entire horror genre."}, {"heading": "Story", "text": "The narrative orbits five college students who plan to spend the weekend in a distant cabin for recreational purposes. As the plot unfolds, the audience is introduced to an intriguing world where monsters are real and played like chess pieces by a hidden organization. What seems like an everyday horror scenario suddenly turns into a sophisticated manipulation controlled by technicians in an underground facility. The twist is they are not merely in horrifying circumstances; they are part of an annual ritualistic sacrifice stretching back timelessly to calm ancient deities. Their fate sealed by the very people controlling and orchestrating the horrifying events. The conclusion, a world-ending scene, leaves the audience in awe and disbelief, breaking all forecasts and expectations."}, {"heading": "Fun Fact", "text": "One of the captivating facets of the filmâ€™s production is the creation of over 60 different types of monsters! The production team had a gargantuan task of designing and breathing life into these mythical creatures - an effort akin to creating an entire new universe within ours. Another fun fact is the unrealized tie-in with the video game Left 4 Dead 2, which was curtailed due to MGM's financial issues, proving the volatile unbeaten path the production of this movie ventured into."}, {"heading": "Similar Movie", "text": "If you enjoyed The Cabin in the Woods, you should certainly watch 'Tucker and Dale vs Evil,' another exemplary horror-comedy. It shifts the usual perspective of harmless hillbillies being the horror element and entrusts them with the role of the actual 'heroes' in unraveling the mystery of the woods."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Despite innumerable obstacles, The Cabin in the Woods hit the big screen in April 2012, forever impacting our concept of horror flicks. Raking in $66.5 million worldwide, this meta-theatrical film proved that how despite being a satire, the right blend of sharp wit, unpredictable narrative, and a stark take on the cliched could turn a seemingly ordinary story into a mind-bending, eerie experience. Goddard's genius brings the unseen world to life and leaves the audience pondering long after the credits roll, not just about the film, but the entire horror genre. The Cabin in the Woods is truly a cinematic journey that enriches, redefines, and reaffirms the horror genre's lasting allure. Following 60 different monsters across an immortal story, here's a film that truly stands alone in a league of its own, highlighting the audience's unending fascination with the supernatural."}], "uuid": "150bc624", "lang": "en", "images": ["http://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/13778F504FB1C78132", "https://blogthumb.pstatic.net/20130103_155/leonjuhee_13572145692111ilbJ_JPEG/untitled.png?type=w2", "https://img.extmovie.com/files/attach/images/135/305/717/050/b9434bfd284fde5e818a1a22de4d9631.jpg", "https://blogthumb.pstatic.net/MjAxOTExMjlfMjU0/MDAxNTc1MDEzODQyMTc2.dr8tet0tsAWxsUyadonR6BD9EbrU1NYwkPdve-nifSog.QekXnBdOz1mTMF5EJSrvjyqzIvVeEZqp-o9DQIqu7WAg.JPEG.playsense_official/1._%C5%AC%B8%AE%BC%CE.jpg?type=w2", "https://mblogthumb-phinf.pstatic.net/MjAyMDA2MTRfMzcg/MDAxNTkyMDYxNTgwNjQ3.A9LD-UrVxTf_UYG0pQJU7egQZzJJLjUGAXd0EWu9Ftwg.lSXPifEcTCajWUAa_uAe02NFBCJv4vLpd9QHT-KLFGcg.JPEG.jeonghj66/1592061579206.jpeg?type=w800", "https://bot-log-product.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/product/watcha/still/mOkg2JO-%EC%BA%90%EB%B9%88_%EC%9D%B8_%EB%8D%94_%EC%9A%B0%EC%A6%88.jpeg", "https://i.namu.wiki/i/qE89uYiaLqgEAn1TTgn8F_J1yf-i6Ml-t0ChYiku0_tGH1TGsHcL2PxiiGVM5pMY_y1-qckvvKLjAa11NF3AmQ.webp", "http://ffuncine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/%EC%BA%90%EB%B9%88%EC%9D%B8%EB%8D%94%EC%9A%B0%EC%A6%88-The-Cabin-in-the-Woods19.jpg", "https://blogthumb.pstatic.net/20130410_154/camoju_1365598459218NJPq4_JPEG/00_01.jpg?type=w2", "http://cdn.ggilbo.com/news/photo/201906/677749_520305_4549.png"], "links": ["https://www.justwatch.com/kr/%EC%98%81%ED%99%94/kaebin-in-deo-ujeu"]}
