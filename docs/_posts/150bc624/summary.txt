The film, The Cabin in the Woods, faced delayed release due to MGM's financial difficulties. Originally set for release in 2010, it was then delayed until 2011 for conversion to 3D and later postponed indefinitely by MGM. Lionsgate eventually acquired the distribution rights, leading to the film's release on April 13, 2012. The film was made with a big team and utilized both sets and the British Columbia Institute of Technology's Aerospace building. The film was also initially set to have a tie-in with the video game Left 4 Dead 2, which was not realized due to MGM's financial trouble. Nevertheless, the studio was allowed to use monsters from Left 4 Dead 2 in the film.
