Heralding from the brilliant mind of Francis Ford Coppola is 'Apocalypse Now,' a 1979 epic war film set in the backdrop of the Vietnam War."}, {"heading": "Story", "text": "Based on the dark and brooding novella Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, the narrative relocates the events of the novella to the ever-treacherous jungles of Vietnam. The plot revolves around the tormented Captain Benjamin L. Willard, portrayed flawlessly by Martin Sheen, who is assigned to hunt down and terminate the rogue Colonel Kurtz played by the enigmatic Marlon Brando."}, {"heading": "Fun Fact", "text": "Here comes a bit of trivia that you might find surprising - Laurence Fishburne, who is now a household name in Hollywood, was just a mere teenager when he wielded his first AK-47 in 'Apocalypse Now'. He had audaciously lied about his age to bag the role and thus embarked on his journey in blockbuster cinema."}, {"heading": "Similar Movie", "text": "While this movie remains a standalone masterpiece, its thematic similarities with other war movies are intriguing. A similar film is 'Platoon,' directed by Oliver Stone, who also places a group of young men in the backdrop of Vietnam War showcasing the different facets of warfare and its ensuing psychological trauma."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In conclusion, 'Apocalypse Now' is a cinematic tour de force that captures the futility and horror of war through the harrowing journey of its protagonist, Captain Willard. With shades of darkness and light, laced with a symbolical journey into the heart of darkness, itâ€™s a film that invites and rewards repeated viewings. It not only serves as a remarkable testament to the enduring relevance of Conrad's seminal novella, but also as a stark reminder of the sheer madness of war. So, if you haven't yet witnessed this spectacle, now is high time you do!"}], "uuid": "61f824be", "lang": "en", "images": ["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2Wx_R02NpMG_d1czB0pjUACTVDE2JiraK6thcCDBmz78G2aNmj9AEbZDHR2Ohc6Wo-uQds02A81krJ7gaQ=s1280-w1280-h720", "https://edgio.clien.net/F01/5760368/7fd0d4992483d.jpg", "https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EVpz8D7IywuI-gTtPK3Env4ZmIRVgm-Hfqg_F_gER1NI7PhU2hnUvTxhvAyL_Yo6RalrBk4iTXJA4yCgWO8", "https://mblogthumb-phinf.pstatic.net/MjAyMDEyMTNfMjc0/MDAxNjA3ODM1NDk1NDAz.9HeM2wvOwQd9t4mLBR48tRTdpRrYNb7FAJLClnQ6EkAg.oSsG8VVgSjeButazE2IEnhP7Y6nqQiNv6fHBJidnEXkg.JPEG.hanseul73/megabox%EF%BC%BF20201213135804.jpg?type=w800", "https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EVpz8D7IywuI-gTtPK3Env4ZmIRVgm-Hfqg_F_gER1NI7PhU2hnUvTxhvAyL_Yo6RalrBk4iTXJA4yCgWO8=w240-h480-rw", "https://mblogthumb-phinf.pstatic.net/MjAxOTAyMDZfMjIx/MDAxNTQ5NDQxODI4NjUy.739Jrc8SFddQBfEfJXNPFOrLEmgR5hOpYbu7iMY1tMYg.UU4NAKD2guP2QzlFv0gJpQCHm3697QTkaa67oX80vtYg.JPEG.hummingshell/qHn1t_1444313715.jpg?type=w800", "https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GyLElqfaMK7sfArhJ041_Lqx3_l8XPfgrQIJ9aVNn2tB2rDA0VqCkYmgSRThYwC9x98jLqJZwMFdzEFqSw=w240-h480-rw", "https://cdn.ikoreadaily.co.kr/news/photo/201603/225169_121579_542.jpg", "https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GyLElqfaMK7sfArhJ041_Lqx3_l8XPfgrQIJ9aVNn2tB2rDA0VqCkYmgSRThYwC9x98jLqJZwMFdzEFqSw", "https://mblogthumb-phinf.pstatic.net/20130304_290/asura8357_1362341197833eLp11_JPEG/Apocalypse_Now_Poster.jpg?type=w420"], "links": ["https://www.justwatch.com/kr/%EC%98%81%ED%99%94/jiogyi-mugsirog"]}
