Apocalypse Now is a 1979 film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. In a new setting of the Vietnam War, Captain Willard is sent on a dangerous journey to assassinate Colonel Kurtz, a renegade officer accused of murder and suspected to be insane. Despite several on-set difficulties and delays, including destruction of sets by weather, unprepared actors and a near-fatal heart attack for one of the stars, the film was released to mixed reviews but eventually became widely acclaimed and achieved great box office success. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning two, and was included in the U.S. Library of Congress' National Film Registry as historically significant.
This is the plot summary of the movie Apocalypse Now. The film follows burned-out military operative, Captain Benjamin L. Willard, who is tasked with eliminating rogue officer Colonel Kurtz. Willard embarks on a journey up the NÃ¹ng River on a U.S. Navy river patrol boat with crewmen Lance, Chef, and Mr. Clean. They face many dangerous encounters throughout the journey such as enemy fire and a surprise attack that result in the deaths of Mr. Clean and Chief. Upon reaching Kurtz's outpost, Willard and Lance find a scene of chaos and madness. They are greeted by an American photojournalist who speaks highly of Kurtz's brilliance. But when they meet Kurtz, they are defended by his followers. Willard is held captive where he is shown Chef's severed head.
The summary appears to be an analysis of characters from the film Apocalypse Now. Marlon Brando plays Colonel Walter Kurtz, a decorated US Army officer who has gone rogue, operating his own military unit based in Cambodia. Other main characters are Lieutenant Colonel William Bill Kilgore, portrayed by Robert Duvall, and Captain Benjamin Willard, portrayed by Martin Sheen. Willard is a veteran assassin on his third tour in Vietnam, sent to eliminate Kurtz. Additionally, Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall, and Sam Bottoms play other military men in the film.
Apocalypse Now is a film that features a variety of actors including Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, Laurence Fishburne, and Dennis Hopper along with many others. Fishburne, who was barely a teenager at the time of shooting, lied about his age to get his role. Although the film is inspired by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, it deviates greatly from the source material. The film is a war film set in Vietnam, while Heart of Darkness is based on Conrad's experiences as a steamboat captain in Africa.
Apocalypse Now is a film by Francis Ford Coppola, loosely based on the novella Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. The novella tells the story of Marlow, a river boat pilot tasked with collecting ivory from Kurtz's outpost. Over time, Marlow becomes obsessed with Kurtz, who has established himself as a god-like figure over a tribe of natives. Similarly, the film depicts Willard as an assassin sent to kill Kurtz. It retains key elements from the novella like Kurtz's god-like status, his fever, and his infamous words Exterminate all the brutes! and The horror! The horror! Many episodes in the film are designed to critique the concepts of civilization and progress, just as in Conrad's novella. 

Characters in the film are speculated to be based on real-life figures from the Vietnam War era. While Coppola denies that the character of Kurtz was modeled after Tony Poe, a paramilitary officer known for his savage methods of warfare, he admits that it was loosely based on Special Forces Colonel Robert B. Rheault. The character of Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore is believed to be based on various figures, including John B. Stockton and infantry general James.
