      "text": "At its core, The 400 Blows follows the tumultuous journey of Antoine Doinel, a young boy struggling to find his place in a world full of authority figures, indifferent parents, and harsh teachers. Antoine's rebellious nature leads him towards a path of delinquency, as he constantly seeks solace and understanding. Throughout the film, Truffaut masterfully captures the emotional turbulence of a troubled youth, painting a poignant picture of the challenges faced by Antoine as he navigates a society that fails to recognize his potential.\n\nAs Antoine's struggles intensify, he ultimately decides to run away from the suffocating city to the vastness of the ocean. This final act of rebellion showcases his desire for freedom and escape from the shackles of an unforgiving society. Truffaut's choice to end the film with a freeze-frame of Antoine's face leaves us with a lasting impression of the character's pain, resilience, and hope for a brighter future."

      "text": "While watching The 400 Blows, one cannot help but notice the incredible attention to detail that Truffaut extends to his storytelling. In one particular scene, Antoine finds comfort in a cinema screening of François Mauriac's Thérèse Desqueyroux. This meta-moment not only emphasizes the power of cinema as an escapism tool for troubled individuals but also serves as an homage to François Truffaut's profound love for the medium."
