The summary is about the discrepancies between the film Munich and the real-life events of the Munich Massacre and the subsequent Mossad operation to track down and assassinate the Black September members responsible.

Former Mossad operatives also criticize the portrayal of Mossad's modus operandi and how Prime Minister Golda Meir recruits the lead character. The Lillehammer affair, where an innocent Moroccan waiter was killed, is also not mentioned in the film.
The film Munich received criticism from former operatives for its inaccurate portrayal of the Mossad's assassination missions. They claimed that the film's depiction of the assassins developing doubts and revulsion over their actions was unrealistic, and that the Mossad provides psychologists for agents who do have doubts.

The director of the Mossad, Meir Dagan, called the film absolute rubbish and stated that it portrayed a distorted view of the truth. Some reviewers criticized the film for equating the Israeli assassins with terrorists, while others questioned the factual basis of the film. The Zionist Organization of America called for a boycott of the film and criticized one of the screenwriters, Tony Kushner, as an Israel-hater.
